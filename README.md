# Low_Frequency_Audio_Amplifier
Project
A Low Frequency Audio Amplifier project focuses on designing and building an audio amplifier that specifically enhances low-frequency sounds . It involves amplifying audio signals in the lower range of the frequency spectrum, typically below 100 Hz, to improve the sound quality and volume of bass-heavy audio sources. The project typically includes components like transistors, capacitors, and resistors to build an efficient circuit that delivers clear and powerful low-frequency output, suitable for audio systems, subwoofers, or audio equipment requiring enhanced bass response.
